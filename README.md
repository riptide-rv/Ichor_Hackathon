## About Ichor

A blood donation app that can connect donors with hospitals can be highly beneficial for several reasons:

With a blood donation app, donors can easily find blood donation centers and hospitals in their area that are in need of blood donations. 

Donors can receive updates on where their donation is needed most and hospitals can communicate their urgent needs for certain blood types.

Blood donation apps can also help raise awareness about the importance of blood donation and encourage more people to donate blood. 

By knowing the number of available blood units, hospitals can avoid stock shortages and ensure that patients receive the blood they need in a timely manner.
